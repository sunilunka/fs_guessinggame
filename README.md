# Fullstack Academy Foundations: Guessing Game

## Part 1: HTML and CSS

This project is building the GUI for the Fullstack Foundations Guessing Game assignment. 

> NOTE: Many of the features in the first part will probably change once the 'engine' itself is written in javascript. 

Using SASS to help write the css. Will try bootstrap later on. 

### The 'novel' concept

The concept I am building on is 'hunting a submarine', the player being in a helo. So each number guessed is a 'ping' on a single use sonobuoy (acoustic sensor in the water). The 'hotter' it gets for a player, the stronger the echoes from the submarine. 

> More to come on this. Number of guesses is predicated on number of ships in the fleet. Each wrong guess is another 'disabled' ship. Last two guesses used up will see a ship sunk. 

The intention is, once the player guesses the 'hottest' sonobuoy, you get to drop a torpedo.
